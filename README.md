# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

  1.	Using the anaconda-navigator to launch the jupyter notebook
  2.	Create and navigate folders path
  3.	Read CSV file, and extract the data for coding
  4.	Create data frame consisting of the data, rows, and columns
  5.	Replace loc method with NAN (Not A Number) function
  6.	Calculate the averages and scores using the count function  

## Purpose and Analysis
